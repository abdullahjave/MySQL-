# MySQL-
In University , I learned about MySQL And Now i'm using it for every project , focusing on DDL and DML operations. I mastered SELECT with WHERE and ORDER BY, as well as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands. I delved into JOINs for combining tables, aggregate functions like COUNT and SUM etc, and using subqueries for complex data retrieval.
